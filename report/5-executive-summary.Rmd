# 5. Executive Summary

We explored song lyrics data from the Musixmatch + Million Songs dataset to derive conclusions about trends in song lyrics and music across time and geography. We asked questions to explore different facets of the dataset and identified some interesting trends. In this section, we will give a short summary of our findings and look at compelling trends in sentiment score, topics, and similar artists.

## From distance-based comparisons

Analizing similarity at different levels gave us interesting information about the data. Since our dataset contains data from many languages (mostly English and Spanish) we saw that when comparing genres, some of them were much closer to each other since they share the language (some songs in certain music genres are mostly in Spanish).

When filtering only by songs that our algorithm labeled as English, we still notice groups of songs that are very different to the rest, when inspecting these songs we realized that most of them are Reggaeton music, a genre that originated in Puerto Rico. The lyrics of Reggaeton usually mix English and Spanish, so our algorithm had difficulties labeling these songs.

Furthermore, when comparing artists, we found that lyrics in Metal music are different from the rest of the popular genres. This makes sense since Metal lyrics usually speak about [dark subjects such as Hell, injustice, mayhem, carnage and death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_lyrics).
