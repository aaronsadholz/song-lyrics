## Tracking progress

## Tools

* Python 3
* To make reproducibility easier, use an environment manager such as [conda](https://github.com/edublancas/commons/blob/master/repos/conda.md)

## Guidelines

Some simple guidelines for collaboration.

### Data files

To make the repo clean, no data files here, raw data is publicly available and our code should be easy enough to run as to get everything we need from the raw data

### Git workflow

Everyone works on their own branch and merges to `master`.

### Code style

* For Python scripts - follow [PEP8](guides/pep8.md)
* For R scripts - follow [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
